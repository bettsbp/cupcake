  <h1>Welcome to Cupcake Shop</h1>
  <p class="flashy">* Our signature cake is listed at the bottom of this page.</p>
  <p>Fresh from the alligator farm, we bring you the Reptilian Delight. This mouthful of amazing, cupcakey goodness will leave you wanting. Made with at least three lbs of fermented alligator flesh, this isn't for the faint of heart. <span class="flashy">You have been warned.</span></p>
  <p><span class="ree">"REEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!"</span> Do you hear that? That's the sound of the African Bullfrog being slaughtered for its meat. Where is that meat going you ask? Why, you're eating it as we speak. Yes, the meat from the frog is <span class="flashy">inside</span> your cake! Cupcake, that is. We're not legally allowed to talk about the actual ingredients, but we know it tastes good and we know that you'll enjoy it. If you don't, there's no refunds. Sorry!</p>
